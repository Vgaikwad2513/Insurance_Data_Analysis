üìä Insurance Data Analysis Project

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a health insurance dataset using Python. The objective is to explore the factors that influence medical insurance charges and
prepare the data for potential predictive modeling. The project covers key data analysis techniques including EDA, statistical analysis, and feature selection.

‚úÖ Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    Handled missing or inconsistent values (if any)
    Converted categorical variables into appropriate formats
     Standardized column names and removed duplicates

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Visualized distributions of features such as age, BMI, and charges
    Explored relationships between categorical variables like smoking status, region, and gender with charges
    Used bar plots, histograms, box plots, and count plots for better understanding

3. Statistical Summary
    Generated descriptive statistics to understand central tendency and spread
    Identified outliers and data skewness
    Used describe(), info(), and group-based aggregations
4. Visualization
    Created visual representations like histograms, box plots, count plots, pair plots, and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn to support the findings from EDA.

5. Feature Engineering
    Created new features such as:
    BMI categories (Normal, Overweight, Obese)
    Binary columns for region (One-Hot Encoding)
    Transformed data to improve analytical depth

6. Feature Selection
    Analyzed feature importance based on statistical significance
    Removed irrelevant or low-impact features
    Prepared data for future machine learning models

7. Correlation Calculation
    Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between numerical features
    Used heatmaps to visualize correlations
    Identified which variables most strongly influence insurance charges

üìå Objective

    The goal of this project is to build a strong understanding of data analysis workflows and extract actionable insights from insurance data, which can later be used for predictive 
    modeling or business decision-making.
